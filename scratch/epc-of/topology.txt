# This is a topology description file, used by SimulationScenario to set the
# number of UEs per eNB, and proper attach each eNB to correct OpenFlow
# switch index. At first, we must set the number of eNBs and OpenFlow switches.

Enbs 4
Switches 5

# Then, we can describe the topology in the following format:
# 1st column: the eNB index (starting at 0).
# 2nd column: the number of UEs at this eNB.
# 3rd column: the switch index to attach this eNB to (starting at 0).
