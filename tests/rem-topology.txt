# This is a topology description file, used by SimulationScenario to set
# default attributes, and proper attach each eNB to correct OpenFlow switch
# index.

# At first, we must set the number of eNBs, OpenFlow switches, and any other
# desired attribute in the following format:
# 1st column: keywork 'set'
# 2nd column: the attribute path.
# 3rd column: the attribute value inside "".

set ns3::LteHexGridNetwork::MacroSites "3"
set ns3::RingNetwork::NumSwitches "4"
set ns3::SimulationScenario::LteRem "true"

# Then, we can describe the topology in the following format (observe the
# strict increasing eNB order):
# 1st column: keywork 'topo'
# 2nd column: the eNB index (starting at 0).
# 3rd column: the number of UEs at this eNB.
# 4th column: the switch index to attach this eNB to (starting at 1, as switch
#             0 is the one attached to gateway).
